"""
AI engine — insights & lifestyle plan.

Rule-based (deterministic, no external calls) narrative analysis of a
person's mood logs, plus a generic evidence-informed weekly routine
template lightly adjusted to their own averages. Intentionally avoids
prescriptive numbers (calories, macros, medication, exact dosages) —
this is a general-wellness scaffold, not clinical or dietary advice.

This is the "recommendation generator" half of the AI engine in the
architecture diagram — it turns raw mood/health data into the
narrative analysis and lifestyle plan the person actually sees.
